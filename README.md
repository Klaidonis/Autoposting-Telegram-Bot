<p style="font-size: 20px">An autoposting bot is a bot that collects a variety of content from telegram channels, a website, and Instagram and sends it to a closed telegram channel.
In a closed telegram channel, there is an administrator who sees all the content and he puts reactions to the content that he liked, after which this bot sequentially sends photos / videos / text to the open channel.</p>

<h2>1. Goal</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px">The document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for a telegram bot for automated content creation, defines the boundaries of implementation and the timing of bot development, identifies and determines the risks of implementation.</p>

<h2>Product Boundaries</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Based on the submitted content sources, the bot parses materials into a closed channel with administrators, and if there is a reaction from any of the administrators in the published post, it sends the entry to the main channel with the frequency set in the settings.</p>
